# Fake-Face-Classification

## Description
This repository hosts the source code, dataset, and resources for a cutting-edge project focused on detecting fake or manipulated faces using deep learning techniques. With the rise of digital manipulation tools, it has become increasingly important to develop robust methods for identifying fake images, especially in contexts such as social media and digital content verification.

In this classification task, I used the Regnet model with adabelief optimizer. 
Using pytorch utils for preprocessing and data splitting I used fake-face datasets that are generated by GAN models.
