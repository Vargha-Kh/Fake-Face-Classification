# Fake-Face-Classification

## Description
In this classification task i used Regnet model with adabelief optimizer. 
Using pytorch utils for preprocessing and data splitting i used fake-face datasets that is generated by GAN models.

<br/>

## How to use:
### First clone the repo
``` git clone https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Fake-Face-Classification.git ```

### Then install the requirements in the directory
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### Run main.py file to begin datasets preprocessing and start training
``` python main.py ```

### Run evaluation.py to evaluate your trained model
``` python evaluation.py ```

<br/>

## Result 
The final result of the classification evaluation was: <br/>
Accuracy: 1.0
Loss: 0.007738873939961195
